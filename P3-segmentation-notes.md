## Flight segmentation for the P3

During ATOMIC/EUREC4A NOAA's P3 aircraft "Miss Piggy" had several sampling objectives, including
surveying the large-scale state of the atmosphere with dropsondes (albeit from a lower altitude than HALO),
surveying the state of the ocean with remote sensing a AXBTs (oceanic dropsondes), profiling aimed
at sampling water isotopes, and _in situ_ sampling of clouds.

Of the [high-level sampling strategies](https://github.com/eurec4a/flight-phase-separation/blob/master/README.md)
used during the campaign the P3 most commonly employed
* transit
* circle
* cloud
* profile
* axbt

The current version (v0.5) of the flight segmentation files is incomplete. The main purpose has been to
supply accurate start and end times for the circles in which dropsondes were launched to facilitate the
construction of the JOANNE combined dropsonde dataset. Flight segmentation for flight RF01-RF05 was
performed by [Adriana Bailey](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/abailey) at NCAR using flight-level data.
Much rougher segmentation of the remaining flights comes from transcription of flight reports by
[Robert Pincus](http://cires.colorado.edu/researcher/robert-pincus) and should be revised.
Feel free to volunteer.
